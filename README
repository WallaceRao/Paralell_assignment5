   Count How many integer point in a Hyper Sphere via CUDA

   159735 Parallel Programming Assignment 5

   To compile: nvcc -o hyperSpace hyperSpace.cu
   To run: ./hyperSpace [nTrails]
   nTrails is 20 by default
   For example:
   "./hyperSpace 50" will generate a hyper sphere for 50 times,
   and count the number of integer coordinate points inside every sphere,
   by both cuda algorithm and sequential algorithm.
